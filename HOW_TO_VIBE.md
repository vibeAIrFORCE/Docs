# How to VIBE with Your VIBE.aiRforce Agent

Welcome, VIBEr! You're about to embark on a journey with a VIBE.aiRforce AI Agent ‚Äì your quirky, smart, and incredibly capable partner in conquering tasks. Whether you choose the Giraffe, Wizard, or Frog, get ready to Think. VIBE. Done.

This guide will help you understand how your agent thinks, operates, and how you can best interact with it to achieve amazing results.

---

## (Understanding Your Agent's Core)

*   **Your Agent's Identity:** Think of your agent as a full-spectrum autonomous assistant. It can research, write, develop software, analyze data, and solve problems creatively. It's got a Linux environment, internet access, and a whole suite of tools.
*   **The VIBE Philosophy:** We're about making advanced tech accessible, powerful, playful, and even a bit meme-worthy.
*   **Workspace:** Your agent operates in a `/workspace` directory. When you talk about files, use paths relative to this (e.g., `src/main.py`, not `/workspace/src/main.py`).

## üöÄ Getting Your VIBE On: Effective Tasking

### 1. Be Clear and Specific
The more precise your request, the better your agent can plan and execute. Your VIBE.aiRforce agent thrives on detail!

*   **Good Examples:**
    *   "Research the top 3 competitors for a new Ethereum-based DeFi protocol focused on yield farming, analyze their tokenomics, current market cap, and recent community activity on Twitter. Provide a summary in a markdown file named `competitor_analysis.md`."
    *   "Create a simple Python script that fetches the current price of Ethereum from CoinGecko API and saves it to `eth_price.txt`. Then, write a short paragraph explaining how to run this script."
    *   "Generate a landing page `index.html` with a connected `style.css` for a new VIBE AI project called 'MemeCoin Analyzer'. The page should have a catchy headline, a brief description, and a placeholder for a demo video. Use our brand colors: Beige Background (`#a99d7e`) for the page, Text Black (`#22201c`) for text, and Hoodie Blue (`#4a7c97`) for accents."
*   **Needs Improvement (Too Vague):**
    *   "Tell me about DeFi."
    *   "Write some code."
    *   "Make a website."

### 2. Understand Its Capabilities
Your agent is packed with tools and skills. Knowing what it can do helps you ask for the right things.

*   **File Operations:** Creating, reading, modifying, deleting files, organizing, converting formats.
*   **Data Processing:** Scraping websites, parsing JSON/CSV/XML, cleaning data, generating reports.
*   **System Operations:** Running CLI commands, managing archives, installing packages (it has `sudo`!).
*   **Web Search & Browsing:** Advanced web searching, extracting content, interacting with web pages (filling forms, clicking buttons).
*   **Visual Input:** It can "see" images you provide using a specific tool. If an image is in the `/workspace`, tell the agent: `Use the 'see-image' tool for 'path/to/your/image.png'`.
*   **Data Providers:** Your agent has direct lines to specific data sources for:
    *   LinkedIn
    *   Twitter
    *   Zillow
    *   Amazon
    *   Yahoo Finance
    *   Active Jobs
    *   **Pro Tip:** If your task involves these, the agent prefers using these providers for accuracy and up-to-date info over general web scraping. "*Use the Twitter data provider to find recent tweets mentioning VIBE.aiRforce.*"

### 3. How Your Agent "Thinks" (The `todo.md` Flow)
Your agent is methodical. When you give it a task, it:
1.  Creates a `todo.md` file for itself, breaking down your request into actionable steps.
2.  Works through these steps one by one.
3.  Provides you with **narrative updates** in Markdown directly in its responses, explaining what it's done, what it's about to do, and why.
4.  Marks tasks as complete `[x]` in its `todo.md`.
5.  Once all tasks are done, it will either use the `complete` tool (if fully finished) or the `ask` tool (if it needs final confirmation or has deliverables for you).

**Your Role in the Flow:**
*   Pay attention to its narrative updates ‚Äì they are your window into its VIBE!
*   If it uses the `ask` tool, it's waiting for your input! This is the *only* time it pauses its work loop for you.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Interacting with Tools & Commands

### CLI vs. Python
*   Your agent prefers using **CLI (Command Line Interface) tools** for efficiency, especially for file operations, text processing, and system tasks. (e.g., `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `jq`, `csvkit`).
*   It uses **Python** for complex logic, custom processing, or when CLI tools aren't enough.

### Long-Running Commands
*   If the agent needs to run something that might take a while (like a development server `npm run dev` or a lengthy data processing script), it will run it **asynchronously** (`run_async="true"`). This means it won't wait for it to finish before doing other things or talking to you.
*   It uses "sessions" to keep related commands organized.

### Sharing Your Agent's Work: Previews & Public Deployment
Your agent can make its creations accessible in a couple of ways:

1.  **Temporary Previews (`expose-port` tool):**
    *   If your agent sets up a local web server or service (e.g., a Next.js app running on port 3000, or an API on port 8000 within its workspace), it can use the `expose-port` tool.
    *   This tool generates a **temporary public URL** that you can use to view and interact with the service directly from your browser.
    *   **Use Case:** Great for development, quick previews of web pages, or testing an API it has built before full deployment.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "*Create a simple Flask API with one endpoint `/hello` that returns 'Hello, VIBEr!'. Run it and expose the port so I can test it.*"

2.  **Permanent Public Deployment (`deploy` tool via Cloudflare Pages):**
    *   For static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets like images), your agent can deploy them to a **permanent public URL** using Cloudflare Pages.
    *   This is for when you want to share the site more broadly or for a longer term.
    *   **Crucial VIBE Check:** The agent will **ALWAYS ask for your confirmation** using the `ask` tool before deploying to a public Cloudflare URL. This ensures you're ready for it to go live.
    *   Ensure all assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) use relative paths for the deployment to work correctly.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "*Take the `index.html` and `style.css` we created for the 'MemeCoin Analyzer' and deploy it to a public server for everyone to VIBE with.*"

### Web Content Extraction Workflow (Important!)
Your agent has a strict hierarchy for getting web information:
1.  **Data Providers First:** If a dedicated data provider exists (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.), it uses that.
2.  **`web-search`:** To find relevant URLs.
3.  **`scrape-webpage`:** To get detailed content from those URLs.
4.  **Direct Browser Tools:** ONLY if `scrape-webpage` fails or the page needs interaction (logins, dynamic content, button clicks).
    *   If it gets stuck (e.g., CAPTCHA), it might use `web-browser-takeover` to ask for your help.

**Pro Tip for Users:** If you know a page requires login or heavy interaction, you can suggest the agent might need to use its direct browser tools after trying `scrape-webpage`. "*The site example.com/dashboard requires a login, you might need to use browser tools after checking with `scrape-webpage`.*"

## üìù Content Creation & Design

### Writing Style
*   Expect detailed content, often in continuous paragraphs, infused with the VIBE.aiRforce spirit. Your agent aims for comprehensive, high-quality documents.
*   It will cite sources if writing based on references.

### Design Tasks (e.g., Reports, Web Pages)
1.  It will first create designs in **HTML+CSS** for flexibility, often incorporating VIBE AI branding elements if requested.
2.  Designs are made with print-friendliness in mind.
3.  The final output for documents is usually a **PDF**, converted from the HTML+CSS.
4.  If it creates web content (like an `index.html`), it will often provide a **preview URL** (using `expose-port`) from its local server so you can see it immediately before considering a permanent `deploy`.

**Key for Website Deployment (Recap):**
*   For temporary viewing or development: Agent uses `expose-port`.
*   For making a static site publicly accessible on a lasting URL: Agent uses `deploy` (via Cloudflare Pages) **after your explicit confirmation via the `ask` tool.**

## üí¨ Communication: The Art of the VIBE

*   **Narrative Updates:** Your agent will communicate proactively in its responses, using Markdown to explain its actions and reasoning. You don't usually need to respond to these unless it specifically uses the `ask` tool.
*   **The `ask` Tool:** This is CRITICAL. When the agent uses `<ask>...</ask>`, it means:
    *   It **NEEDS your input** (clarification, confirmation, choices, missing info).
    *   It **PAUSES** its work until you respond.
    *   This is how it delivers files to you or asks for final approval before completing a task (like deploying a website!).
*   **Attachments:** When the agent creates something for you to see (HTML files, PDFs, images, reports), it will attach them when it uses the `ask` tool. **If you should SEE it, it will ATTACH it.**
*   **`complete` Tool:** The agent uses this ONLY when ALL tasks in its `todo.md` are finished and verified. This terminates its execution for that request.

**Golden Rule:** If your agent says `<ask>I've drafted the landing page and exposed it for preview at [URL]. What do you think before we consider deploying it publicly?</ask>` and attaches `index.html`, it's your turn to speak! Otherwise, its narrative updates are just keeping you in the VIBE loop.

## üí° Pro Tips for a Smooth VIBE

*   **Iterative Refinement:** If the first result isn't perfect, provide feedback. Your agent can revise. "*This VIBE is good, but can you make the blue accents brighter and add a section about our Giraffe mascot?*"
*   **Complex Tasks:** Break them down if they feel too large, or trust the agent to create a detailed `todo.md`. You can always ask, "*What's your plan for this task?*"
*   **File Paths:** Remember, all file paths are relative to `/workspace`.
*   **Ask for Previews:** For web content or designs, feel free to ask the agent: "*Can you run a local server and expose the port so I can preview the `index.html` file?*"
*   **Patience for Complex Steps:** Some operations (like deep research or code generation) take time. The agent's narrative updates will let you know it's working hard, vibing on your request.
*   **Error Handling:** The agent is designed to be robust, but if it seems stuck or confused, try rephrasing or simplifying the immediate goal. If it makes 3 `todo.md` updates without completing a task, it's programmed to reassess or ask you for guidance.
